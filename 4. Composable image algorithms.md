# Composable image algorithms

This section will present another cool feature of *friday*. As I said in the
introduction, the library has the property that you can compose algorithms and
expect them to be fused in a single and efficient loop.

The main motivation when designing this feature was to be able to design complex
but efficient transformations from a small set of simple functions (like `map`).

## Image and functions isomorphism

To understand how the compiler and the library are allowed to fuse these
algorithms, one must look back at *referential transparency*. Referential
transparency is the property which asserts that pure function calls can be
replaced by the values they generate without changing the output of the program.

This property has an interesting effect on images. Images (and more generally
arrays and vectors) may be thought of as functions whose domains are restricted
to a contiguous subsets of the integers.
