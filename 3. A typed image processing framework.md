# A typed image processing framework

To understand how a typed image processing framework, one must be aware of how
most existing image processing libraries are designed.

Images in image processing libraries must be generic data structures relative
to the pixel's type, as users will expect to use the same interface whatever
the image content is.

If you take a look at *OpenCV* --- which is probably the most popular image
processing library --- you will observe that their images are stored in a data
structure similar to this *C++* type:

    class Mat {
        int type;
        int rows, cols;
        uchar *data;

        // Returns a pixel's value.
        templace <typename T>
        inline T at(int x, int y)
        {
            return *((T *) data + cols * y + x);
        }
    }

They implement pixel polymorphism using (unsafe) pointer castings, a familiar
technique to C programmers. They also add a `type` field so programmers can
discriminate pixel types at runtime and a function which carries out the pointer
arithmetic to get a pixel value.

The first major issue with this approach is that **neither the compiler nor the
runtime are aware of the types of the data they handle**. i.e. a grey-scale
image (made of 8 bits pixels) has exactly the same type as an RGBA image (made 
of 32 bits pixels).

You're entirely free to write something like this:

    Mat grey_image = get_grey_image();
    grey_image.at<int>(10, 15);

... which will fail **silently** at runtime, generating silly values.
This is not even dynamic typing. Dynamic typing implies type-checking at
runtime. But there is no type-checking in this case: it is literally untyped
programming. In OpenCV, it is the programmer's responsibility to check that
images are correctly typed by looking at the `type` field of the `Mat` 
data-structure.

Function signatures are also too weak to tell exactly which image types
functions can accept as input or generate as output.
Function authors are required to write a documentation telling exactly what
image types are handled, and they need to keep that documentation up to date.
It is common in practice to find undocumented or incorrectly documented
functions, even in a library as used as *OpenCV*.


The second major issue is that **you do not have true genericity**. It is quite
hard --- and in most cases impossible --- to write efficient algorithms that
work on any pixel type.

In the case of *OpenCV*, algorithms are often written in multiple
instances, each specialized for a pixel type. For example, the thresholding
function starts with a large conditional expression which dispatches the
execution to different instances of the algorithm, depending on the pixel type.
That also means that you can not expect the function to work with a new pixel 
type.

## What friday does

*friday* is entirely type-safe and generic in respect to pixel and image types. 
Images are accessed and generated using two type class interfaces which do not 
restrict how images are represented.

*You can write algorithms and expect the type-inferer to find the most generic
signature for it*.

As an example, let's write a function which to convert a grey-scale image into
a black and white image:

    -- First, we create a simple function to convert grey-scale values (in the
    -- range [0; 255]) into black (0) and white (255) values.
    f val = if val > 127 then 255 else 0

    -- Then we use the `map` function to define our black and white 
    -- transformation.
    --
    -- `map` is a function that applies the given function to each pixel
    -- of an image, returning a new image.
    blackAndWhite img = map f img


If we ask the compiler what is the type of `blackAndWhite`, it will give us the
following signature:

    blackAndWhite :: (Num (ImagePixel src), Num (ImagePixel res),
                      Ord (ImagePixel src), FunctorImage src res)
                  => src -> res

The function has two type variables `src` and `res`, corresponding to the source
and the generated images, respectively. Four constraints are applied on these
two image types:

* `Num (ImagePixel src)` and `Num (ImagePixel res)` require the pixel types of 
  both images to be numbers.
* `Ord (ImagePixel src)` require our source image to be composed of comparable
  pixels. This is because of the call to the `>` operator in our `f` function.
* `FunctorImage src res` means that we must be able to apply the `map` function
  to generate a image of type `res` from an image of type `src`.

The function obviously works if we use it on a grey-scale image. But if we
give it an RGB image, the compiler will fail with the following error:

    Could not deduce (Num RGBPixel)

This is the compiler way of telling us that an `RGBPixel` is not an number, and 
that thereby we can't compare it to another number (127 in our example).

*friday* uses *type signatures as a kind of documentation that the compiler can 
understand and enforce*. This is really different from what is happening with 
libraries like *OpenCV*.

### Type families

Readers who are used to work with generics or templates in other programming
languages (like *Java*, *C++* or *C\#*) could argue that the previous example
could be as well implemented in these languages. That's true, but this first
example was rather simple.

Yet *friday* makes use of more advanced *Haskell*'s type system features
that doesn't exist in these languages. The most important feature is called
*type families*. Type families are like type system functions. The concept is
too wide to be explained in this document but can be easily guessed with an
example:

Let's talk about *image histograms*. Image histograms are the color
distribution of images --- i.e. the number of pixels for each color. One 
thing interesting about histograms is that they have as many dimensions as the
image they are computed from has channels. A grey-scale histogram will be a
single dimension vector, an RGB histogram will be a three dimensions array, an
RGBA histogram will be a four dimensions array and so on ... For example, the
value of an RGB histogram at index `(0, 255, 0)` will give you the number of
green pixels in the image.

*friday* uses type families to enforce type safety when computing histograms
from images.

The following expression computes a three dimensions histogram from an RGB
image:

    hist :: Histogram DIM3
    hist = histogram rgbImg

As we can see in the type signature, the `Histogram` data type receives a type
parameter, namely `DIM3`. `DIM3` is an alias for a tuple of three integers.
This tuple will be used to index values in the histogram.

But what if we tried to compute a single dimension histogram from this very same
image ?

    hist :: Histogram DIM1
    hist = histogram rgbImg

The compiler will fail with the following message:

    Couldn't match type 'DIM3' with 'DIM1'

That's because there is a type system constraint on the `histogram` function
which uniquely determines the dimension of an histogram from an image pixel
type.

This kind of constraint is more complex to express that those from the previous
example and requires an advanced type system. In *Haskell*, it's achieved with
type families.

### Empty types

*friday* relies heavily on another type system concept named *empty types*.

Empty types are types that do not hold any value. An empty type could be
defined in C as:

    struct my_empty_type { };

In Haskell, they are defined like this:

    data MyEmptyType

I used them in several places as an alternative to enumerations.

For example, the library provides the `load` or the `save` functions to load 
and save image  from and to the hard drive. You are required to specify the 
image format (*BMP*, *JPEG*, *PNG* ...). However, some formats (like *GIF*) can 
be read from but can't be saved to. The `load` function also accepts the 
special `Autodetect` format which detects the image type using the file's 
headers.

Instead of using an enumeration of constants to specify file formats like one
would have done in *C++*, each format is its own empty type:

    data Autodetect
    data BMP
    data JPEG
    data PNG
    data GIF
    ...

Then you have two type classes, `LoadImageType` and `SaveImageType`. Formats
which can be used with `load` are instance of `LoadImageType` and formats
which can be used with `save` are instance of `SaveImageType`.

If you try to save an image as a *GIF* file, you will get the following error at
*compile time*:

    No instance for (SaveImageType GIF)

As a side note, empty types don't exist at runtime and have no memory
footprint. They are only known to the compiler.
