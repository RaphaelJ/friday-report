# Introduction

This document will describe a project I'm working on for about two years. This
is not the unique personal project I worked on during this period, but it is
probably the largest and the most serious one.

The project is named **friday** [1] and is a *image processing framework*
written in the strongly typed functional programming language **Haskell**.

I started thinking about a functional image processing library while doing an
internship in computer vision three years ago. I noticed that most bugs I
encountered were avoidable if the library we used (*OpenCV*) was written in a
more functional way, and with a stronger type system.

While a lot of image processing libraries already exist, designing one from
scratch for a functional programming language is actually quite interesting.

The three distinging features of this project are:

* A reliance on a strongly typed programming language to detect programming
  errors directly at compile time. I will give in the course of this document
  a few examples of bugs which can be avoided at compile time with *friday*
  while they will silently occur at runtime with other libraries.
* The ability to fuse image transformations.
  For example, if one wishes to apply a rotation on a resized image, *friday*
  and the *Haskell* compiler are able to generate a single loop that will
  combine the resizing and the rotating operations into a single algorithm,
  removing the need to store the intermediate resized image [2].
* Being extremely generic. One could expect to create new algorithms, new
  pixel color-spaces or new ways to store an image [3] while being able to reuse
  existing algorithms, data types or the fusion mechanism.
  Because of that, I prefer to use the expression *image processing framework*
  than *image processing library*, to emphasis on  the fact that the library is
  more a set of primitives to write image processing algorithms in a functional
  programming way than a collection of algorithms.

[1] Notice the lower case *f*. The name was chosen without serious thinking,
mostly because I start looking for a name for the project while having a good
time drinking some special Belgian beers with friends on a Friday evening.

[2] This feature might seem disturbing for programmers unfamiliar with
functional programming. The technique involved, named *deforestation* or
*stream fusion*, is however well known to functional programmers. A similar
feature exist in some list, array and stream libraries.

[3] One use case involving the creation of a new image type could be to
interface with an existing library or hardware (GPU ...).

## Other features

The library currently supports four color-spaces: RGB, RGBA, HSV and gray-scale
pixels. Images can be converted between these color-spaces.

The following features and algorithms have been implemented:

* various image transformations: resize, crop, vertical and horizontal
  flip, flood fill ...
* various filters: morphological transformations (dilation and erosion),
  blurring (mean and Gaussian blurs) and derivative operators (Sobel and Scharr
  operators), with a generic interface to create new filters from kernels.
* non-adaptive, adaptive, Otsu and SCW thresholding methods.
* edge detection using Canny's algorithm.
* fully type-safe support for masked images.
* histogram computation, histogram comparisons and image equalization by its
  histogram.

Loading and saving images from and to disk is delayed to a C library, with
wrappers provided by the separate *friday-devil* [4] package.

## Availability and source code

The first version of the library was released with its online documentation on
the official *Haskell*'s package repository in August 2014
(*[hackage.haskell.org/package/friday](
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/friday)*) with a second major version in
January 2015.
A third experimental version is currently developed and is available in the
*v0.3* branch of the GitHub source repository
(*[github.com/RaphaelJ/friday](http://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday)*).

According to the *Haskell*'s package repository statistics, about 150 users
compile and install the library each month, making it the third most used image
processing package in the repository.

## Document structure

I will assume that the reader has no knowledge of the *Haskell* programming
language. Some *Haskell* rudiments will be given in the following section to
introduce the language's syntax and type-system. These basics are mandatory to
understand the other parts of the documents as *Haskell* differs from the most
common programming languages in almost every possible way.

The second section will expose the main issue
