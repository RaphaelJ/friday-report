# A taste of Haskell

Haskell is a functional and strongly typed programming language.

The first part of this section will explain that functional programming is
mostly about programming without mutation and side effect.

## What is functional programming

Functional programming is, in its most universal definition, a programming style
which tries to *avoid muting state* and mutable data, by *emphasing the use of
expressions instead of the execution of commands and instructions*.

See the following C imperative program which manipulates a rectangle:

    struct rect_t {
        int x, y, width, height;
    }

    void move(rect_t *rect, int dx, int dy)
    {
        rect->x += dx;
        rect->y += dy;
    }

    rect_t my_rectangle()
    {
        rect_t rect = {
            .x     = 0,   .y      = 0,
            .width = 100, .height = 100
        };

        move(&rect, 10, 10);

        return rect;
    }

And now compare it with this other C program written in a functional style:

    struct rect_t {
        int x, y, width, height;
    }

    rect_t move(rect_t rect, int dx, int dy)
    {
        return {
            .x      = rect.x + dx,
            .y      = rect.y + dy,
            .width  = rect.width,
            .height = rect.height
        };
    }

    rect_t my_rectangle()
    {
        rect_t rect = {
            .x     = 0,   .y      = 0,
            .width = 100, .height = 100
        };

        return move(rect, 10, 10);
    }

The main difference is that in the the functional style, *we never modify
any data previously created*. In our example, when the original rectangle needs
to be moved a *new* rectangle will be created. In functional programming there
is no *destructive update* and data are *immutable*.

With this absence of destructive updates, variables are used in a mathematical
sense, as identifiers to immutable expressions or values. In the `my_rectangle`
function of the example, `rect` is associated to the value of an expression, 
and this value will never change.

Functions which are written in this functional style, without using any
mutable state, are called *pure* and are very close to the mathematical
definition of a function.

### Removing mutable states matter

Prohibiting mutable states has the effect of *removing all side effects*.
Functions cannot call `printf()` or write to a file, as this can be seen as
modifying the state of the runtime environment. Nor they can read from a file as
this will be equivalent to read from a mutable state.

*Pure functions are deterministic*. A pure function call can be replaced by the
value it will return. This is called *referential transparency*. Referential
transparency is the key concept to understand why *friday* and the Haskell
compiler are able to safely fuse two image transformations into a single loop.

While time is important in imperative programming (as it determines the order
in which instructions are executed), it is a implicit concept in functional
programming.
As pure expressions always return the same values, the time at which they are
executed does not matter. In Haskell, expressions and function calls are
evaluated in a dependency graph: think about a spreadsheet, you do not define
the order in which cells are computed, they are evaluated as needed.

Pure functions are also easier to test, thread-safe by design and more
reusable. Code written in a functional style is often more easier to reason
about as you only need to find the definition of a variable to get its actual
value (this is not true in an imperative program as values change over time).

### Side effects are a necessary evil

A sharp-minded reader will argue that a program that does not do any side
effect is useless. And indeed, programmers write programs for their side
effects.

Haskell allows you to write functions which do side effects but they will
be tagged differently by the type system. Here is also the idea of
*contamination*: any function which call a function tagged as having side
effects will be tagged as well. Similary, a function which has been typed as not
having side effect will not be able to call a function with side effects.

Good functional programmers will try to write as few functions with side
effects as possible, to benefit from the advantages of pure functions.
