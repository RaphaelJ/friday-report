This repository contains a set of documents I wrote in the context of a personal
project I had to present to get my Master's degree in Computer Science from the
University of Li√®ge, Belgium. It's not related to my Master's thesis.

They describe how I implemented *[friday](https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday)*,
**an image processing library for Haskell**. The library uses quite advanced
functional programming tricks to implement features like **automatic
parallelization of algorithms** or **the ability to fuse a chain of image
processing algorithms in single efficient loops**.

The target audience was composed of professors who didn't had any extensive
experience with functional programming. **I wrote these documents in such a way
that they can be understood by programmers having only experience with
statically typed programming languages** (like *C++*, *Java* or *C#*). I think
it could be an interesting short read (about 20 printed pages) for such people
who are curious about what can be achieved with functional programming
languages.

Pardon my English, I'm not a native speaker.
